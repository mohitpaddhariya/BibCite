> **BibCite** is a lightweight browser extension that supercharges your research workflow on Google Scholar. It adds a direct "BibTeX" button to each search result, letting you instantly save and manage citations without extra clicks or popups.

---

## **Why BibCite?**

The standard process for getting a BibTeX citation from Google Scholar involves multiple steps: click "Cite," wait for a popup, then click "BibTeX," which opens a new page you have to copy from. This interrupts your research flow.

BibCite eliminates these extra steps. It provides a **direct, one-click button** to fetch and save the BibTeX data instantly in the background, keeping you on the search results page. It's built to be fast, simple, and unobtrusive.
