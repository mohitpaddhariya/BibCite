# Privacy Policy for BibCite

**Last Updated:** July 20, 2025

This Privacy Policy explains how the BibCite browser extension ("the extension") handles information. Our commitment is to protect your privacy and collect only the absolute minimum information necessary for the extension to function.

## Information We Collect

To provide its features, the extension collects the following:

* **Website Content:** When you click the "BibTeX" button on a Google Scholar page, the extension reads and processes the corresponding BibTeX citation text. This is the sole piece of website content the extension handles.

* **User Activity:** The extension detects a **click** event on the "BibTeX" button it creates. This is the only user activity monitored and is necessary to trigger the citation-saving function.

To be clear, the extension **does not** collect, store, or access any Personally Identifiable Information (PII) such as your name, email, location, IP address, or broader web history.

## How We Use Your Information

The collected BibTeX citation text is used exclusively to display it in the extension's popup window, allowing you to view, edit, and copy it. It is not used for any other purpose, such as tracking, analytics, or advertising.

---

## Data Storage and Security

The single, most recent BibTeX citation you save is stored locally on your computer using the browser's standard storage API (`chrome.storage.local`). This data **never leaves your device** and is not sent to any external server. You have full control to remove this data at any time by using the "Clear" button within the extension.

---

## Data Sharing

We **do not** sell, trade, rent, or share any of your information with third parties. Period.

---

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy in the future. Any changes will be reflected in a new version of the extension and an updated "Last Updated" date on this page.
